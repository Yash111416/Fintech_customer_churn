## Stripe Consumer Churn Prediction

This project explores predicting customer churn for Stripe, a payment processing platform. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior that indicate a high likelihood of churn. 

### Libraries

This project utilizes the following Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization:

* **Core Libraries:**
    * `numpy`: Numerical computing library.
    * `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
    * `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library (used with seaborn).
    * `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization library.
* **Machine Learning Libraries:**
    * `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for various algorithms.
        * `ensemble`: Includes Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
        * `linear_model`: Includes Logistic Regression classifier.
        * `model_selection`: Tools for train-test-split, GridSearchCV, etc.
        * `preprocessing`: Includes StandardScaler for data normalization.
    * `imblearn`: Provides techniques for handling imbalanced datasets (used Random UnderSampling here).
    * `xgboost`: Implementation of the XGBoost gradient boosting framework.
* **Clustering Libraries:**
    * `scikit-learn.cluster`: KMeans clustering implementation.
    * `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`: Hierarchical clustering functionalities.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    * `scikit-learn.manifold`: TSNE for dimensionality reduction.
* **Evaluation Metrics:**
    * `scikit-learn.metrics`: Classification report, confusion matrix functions.
* **Visualization (Optional):**
    * `plotly.express`: Interactive visualization library (not strictly required).

### Further Improvements and Remarks

The document outlines several possibilities for enhancing the model and analysis:

* **Alternative Clustering Techniques:** Explore hierarchical clustering (agglomerative and divisive) and Isolation Forest for customer segmentation.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions while preserving variance and compare results with current methods.
* **Data Quality:** Implement test statistics to analyze data further and potentially generate additional features.
* **Data Acquisition and Feature Engineering:** Collaborate with domain experts to acquire high-quality data and perform rigorous feature engineering.
* **Outlier Handling:** Consider using autoencoders to handle outliers, especially for large datasets.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Explore RNNs to capture potential context between sequential transactions.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Discuss with domain experts and simulate customer behavior to identify relevant attributes.
* **Data Quality for Sales:** Account for specific days like Cyber Monday or Thanksgiving that might influence churn.
* **Time Series Anomaly Detection:** Implement time series based anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns.
* **Model Tuning and Evaluation:** Analyze False Negatives, True Negatives, False Positives, and True Positives to further refine the models.

These improvements can be implemented iteratively to achieve a more robust and accurate churn prediction model.

### Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install <library_name>`. (e.g., `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imblearn xgboost plotly`)
2. Download or access your Stripe customer data.
3. Preprocess the data (cleaning, handling missing values, etc.).
4. Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
5. Implement the machine learning models outlined in the code (or modify as needed).
6. Evaluate the model performance using classification metrics.
7. Experiment with the suggested improvements and re-evaluate the models.

This readme provides a starting point for building a Stripe customer churn prediction model. Feel free to adapt and expand upon this framework to create a solution tailored to your specific data and business needs.
